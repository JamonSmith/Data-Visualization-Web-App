# Data-Visualization-Web-App
Fairly simple web application coded in JavaScript and HTML that allows users to create and save .pdf and .txt files to their computer. It also allows users to upload data in the form of a .csv file or a spreadsheet and create a visualization of that data. (Still looking to make improvements and clean up the functionality).
